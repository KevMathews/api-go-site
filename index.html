                    <p>API-Go was created for one simple reason, <b>to ease the use of APIs!</b>
                        <br />

                        Anyone from an aspiring student, to a senior level dev can benefit from this package.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        No more squandering precious dev time studying
                        <br />
                        up on how to interact with a particular API.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <span>With <b>API-Go</b> that information, with examples, will be at
                            <br />your fingertips for easy
                            reference!</span>

                        <br />
                        <hr>
                    <h3>So, how exactly does API-Go save you time?</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        We accomplish this in 2 simple ways:

                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By presenting you a simplified 'cheat-sheet' of the endpoints and parameters for the API of
                        your choice.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>

                        By providing examples of fetch calls, and showing you the data in json format that is
                        returned.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <div class='introduction-body'>
                    <p>Essentially, we save you time by packaging together the information needed to get
                        <br /> started with some commonly used Free APIs, and present the info to you in an
                        <br />easy to read and access format.
                </div>
            </section>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />

            <section class="main-section" id='Usage'>
                <hr>
                <header>
                    Usage
                </header>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    To get started you can download API-Go from either GitHub or via our website.
                    <br /> Alternatively, you can also clone the directory from Github.
                    <br />
                    - We will be deploying soon via NPM -
                    <br />
                    <img src='/img/use1.jpg' />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the files are located on your computer, go into the folder and run '<i>npm i -g</i>'
                    <br />
                    in the terminal to install our package globally on your computer.<br />
                    <b>Take note that some installations might require sudo or administration access</b>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Once done, launch API-Go from the directory you want to create your project in.
                    <br />
                    *Make sure the directory you launch API-Go in ISN'T a git hub repo already *
                    <br />
                <p>
                    Once inside the directory of choice, type api-go from your terminal command line
                </p>
                <h4>You will be presented with several questions while navigating on the command line</h4>
                <p>
                    First you will be asked to choose which API you want to work with
                    <br />
                    <img src='/img/use2.jpg' />

                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, you need to enter an API key if you have one, and name your project
                    <br />so we can properly create the directory structure for you.
                </p>
                <img src='/img/use3.jpg' />
                <p>
                    After that is all completed, give the process up to a minute or so to download and
                    <br />
                    install the packages and node modules needed to get you up and running.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once completed cd into the newly created directory that will contain all of the dynamically
                    <br />
                    created files for you and type '<i>npm start</i>' in a terminal window to launch.
                    <br />

                </p>

                <img src='/img/use4.jpg' />
                <br />
                <p>
                    What you will have is essentially a 'cheat sheet' at your fingertips to be able to reference
                    <br />
                    query params and have example fetches to help jump start your development.
                </p>
                <br />
                </p>

                    <img src='/img/example-landing-page.jpg' />
                    <p>A big KEY to our design is the examples tab. It allows you quickly and easily access API
                        references.</p>
                    <p>Clicking on the Examples link in the NavBar will lead you to a tab with information similar
                        to
                        below.
                        <br />
                        The tables are easy to view, so you can quickly find what parameters are available for use and
                        what they do.
                        <br />
                        Example queries are shown as well, along with returned JSON samples so you can see how the data
                        is formatted.

                <p>
                    As a Junior Dev, Fetch calls can be a tricky to setup, and very time consuming to figure out.
                    <br />


                </p>
                <p>The example below is a React Hooks Fetch to the Nasa Photo of the Day API.
                    <br />
                    Overall a very simple fetch, as it's pretty
                    straightforward, and has just 1 endpoint.
                </p>
                <div class='images-container'>
                    <div class='images'>
                        <img src='/img/fetch1.jpg' />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Let's walk you through the example above to hopefully demystify it some</h4>
                <br>
                <p>We create <i>photoData</i> as a variable and <i>setPhotoData</i> as the function to update the
                    variable's value.
                    <br />
                    React's <i>useState</i> hook is used to set the initial state of <i>photoData</i> to an empty
                    object.
                    <br />
                    The async function <i>fetchPhoto</i> helps avoid asyncronous issues that can occur when completing
                    <br />
                    fetch requests. We use <i>setPhotoData</i> to update the <i>photoData</i> variable with the API's
                    response.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Instead of using a lifecycle method, we call setData inside the useEffect React hook. The empty
                    <br />
                    array on Line 14 may look confusing at first, but let’s refer back to the <a
                        href='https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html' target='_blank'>React Hooks Documentation!</a>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    “If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an
                    <br />
                    empty array ([]) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any
                    values
                    <br />
                    from props or state, so it never needs to re-run. This isn’t handled as a special case — it follows
                    <br />
                    directly from how the dependencies array always works.
                    <br /><br />
                    We pass the empty array into useEffect to ensure that the effect runs once and to prevent the
                    <br />
                    component from perpetually re-rendering. The function component’s return statement displays
                    <br />
                    attributes by calling the format photoData.url or photoData.title as example.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Both components now fetch NASA’s API successfully and render the image, title,
                    <br />
                    date, and description as depicted in the image below.

                <br />
                <p>The next round of additions and updates are already well underway!</p>
                <br />
                <p>What's currently under development?</p>
                <h3> *More apis, more Apis, and even more APIs!*</h3>

                <p class='exampleP'>We will be looking to greatly expand the number of APIs we have implemented,
                    <br />
                    with the expectation to have well over 50+ by summer 2021
                </p>
                <p>Imminent additions will be: the Yahoo Finance API, SkyScanner, Pokemon,
                    <br /> a Weather Api, Starwars, Marvel, and many many more.<br />
                </p>
                <h4>Possibly even more exciting, will be the implementation of an interactive<br />
                    development environment right into your coding window!
                </h4>
                <p class='exampleP'>
                    It will enable writing and executing of code<br />
                    live and in real time in a fully interactive sandbox window.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h4>Constantly tabbing out, or looking at another window for <br />localhost:3000 to
                    see what your code looks like, will be a thing of the past!
                </h4>
                <br />
                <p class='exampleP'>

                    It will save you countless hours of dev time being able to code <br />
                    while simultaneously testing endpoints right there live.<br />
                    Think of it as code pen built right into your browser/code editor!<br />

                    <img src='/img/example-browser-editor.jpg' />
                    <br />


                    This will enable us to not only provide you with live working fetches,
                    <br />
                    using your API key, but allow you to easily customize the queries seeing what they return.
                    <br />
                    A quick, easy, and a fast solution to testing and implementing exactly what you want in your code!
                    <br />



                <h3>Code Editor will be LIVE by end of Spring 2021!</h3>

                                    <p class='aboutText'>Hi there, I'm Kevin! I was born and raised in the San Francisco
                                        Bay Area, and went to college at San Jose State University. Coding has always
                                        been a passion of mine since I was about 7 years old. I started teaching myself
                                        to program in basic on an old TI994A computer we had stored in the garage, and
                                        was hooked instantly. Beyond coding I have a lot of passions in life from
                                        basketball, to the UFC, to just enjoying the 'Dad' life and trying to be the
                                        best husband and father I can be.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Professionally I've worn a lot of hats in my life, and not only am I a web
                                        developer, but I
                                        have
                                        a background in sales and entrepreneurship. As a business owner I learned how to
                                        handle and
                                        resolve a wide range of issues which now enables me to approach projects with
                                        confidence and
                                        creativity. I bring my passion for a clean and organized work product into each
                                        project, and
                                        I
                                        love nothing more then working as a team to find the most efficient and elegant
                                        solutions to
                                        complex problems.

                                    <p class='aboutText'>Howdy! I’m Josh! I am from Houston, TX born and raised. I am 21
                                        years old and have always wanted to be a software engineer from an early age
                                        when my father taught me about computers. I was going to college but then
                                        decided to take a non-traditional route with the General Assembly Software
                                        Engineering Immersive Program. Though never being in a professional position I
                                        am seeking one with the skills i have learn and through showing off want I can
                                        do, for example, this project.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        From the jobs I have had, there are many skills
                                        and traits I have learned that apply to the software engineering industry. I
                                        have a lot of passion with code and this industry, so whatever comes my way I
                                        will always put my best effort to supply quality production product. This is
                                        just the beginning of my career and I am more than excited for what comes in the
                                        future.

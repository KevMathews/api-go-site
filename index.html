                    <span>API-Go was created for one simple reason, <b>to ease the use of APIs!</b></span>
                    <br />

                    Anyone from an aspiring student, to a senior level dev can benefit from this package.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    No more squandering precious dev time studying up on
                    how to interact with a particular API.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span>With <b>API-Go</b> that information, with examples, will be at your fingertips for easy
                        reference!</span>

                    <h3>So, how exactly does API-Go save you time?
                        <br />
                        We accomplish this in 2 simple ways:
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        By presenting you a simplified 'cheat-sheet' of the endpoints and parameters for the API of
                        your choice.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        By providing examples of fetch calls, and showing you the data in json format that is returned.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <div class='introduction-body'>
                    Essentially we packaged together the information needed to get started with some commonly used Free
                    API's,
                    </br> and
                    present the info to you in an easy to read and access format.

            <section class="main-section" id='Usage'>
                <hr>

                    Usage
                </header>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    To get started you can download API-Go from either GitHub or via our website.
                    <br /> Alternatively, you can also clone the directory from Github.
                    <br />
                    - We will be deploying soon via NPM -
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the files are located on your computer CD into the folder and run '<i>npm i -g</i>' to install
                    <br />
                    our package globally on your computer.<br />
                    <b>Take note that some installations might require sudo or administration access</b>

                </p>
                <p>
                    From there you want to create a directory to launch API-go and your project from.
                    <br />*Make sure
                    the directory you launch api-go in ISN'T already a git hub repo already *
                    <br />
                <p>
                    Once inside the directory type api-go from your terminal command line
                </p>
                <h4>You will be presented with several questions while navigating on the command line</h4>
                <p>
                    <li>You will be asked which API you want to work with?</li>
                </p>
                <li>If you have an API key for it yet?</li>
                <p>
                    If you do paste into into the command line when prompted and we will automatically insert it in
                    the
                    code for you when presenting ypou with examples and fetches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next you need to name your project so we can properly create the directory structure for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that is all completed give the process up to a minute or so to download and install the
                    packages and node modules needed to get you up and running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once completed cd into the newly created directory that will contain all of the dynamically
                    created
                    files for you and type npm start to alternatively open VSCode or similar code editor open the
                    imbedded terminal and type npm start
                </p>
                <p>
                    What you will have is essentially a 'cheat sheet' at your finger tips to be able to reference
                    query
                    params and have example fetches to help get your jump started in your development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    KEY to our design was including the examples in a navbar tab for you. The idea behind it is you
                    can
                    fully develop your react site leaving the nav bar component in place to reference the examples
                    quickly as needed. when you are done needing the use of the examples its as simple as removing
                    the
                    nav bar component from the router.
                </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>Once API-Go has been fully setup and you have launch it via npm start in your command terminal
                        <br />you will see this page at localhost:3000 in your browser
                    </p>
                    <h4>Take note you can easily jump between examples and your project via the NavBar</h4>

                    <p>
                    <p>Clicking on the Examples link in the NavBar will lead you to the a tab with information similar
                        to
                        below.
                        <br />
                        The tables are easy to view ,so you can quickly find what parameters are available for use and
                        what
                        they do.
                        <br />
                        Example queries are shown as well, along with returned JSON samples so you can see how the data
                        is
                        formatted.

                    Setting up calls can be hard and tricky to set up for junior devs,
                    <br />
                    and annoying time sinks for even experienced ones.

                </p>
                <p>The example below is a React Hooks Fetch to the Nasa Photo of the Day API.
                    <br />
                    Overall a very simple fetch, as it's pretty
                    straightforward, and has just 1 endpoint.
                </p>
                <div class='images-container'>
                    <div class='images'>
                        <img src='/img/fetch1.jpg' />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4>Let's walk you through the example above to hopefully demistify it some</h4>
                <p>
                    We create photoData as a variable and setPhotoData as the function to update the
                    variable's value.
                    <br />
                    React's useState hook is used to set the initial state of photoData to an empty object.
                    <br />
                    The async function fetchPhoto helps avoid asyncronous issues that can occur when completing
                    <br />
                    fetch requests. We use setPhotoData to update the photoData variable with the API's response.
                </p>

                <br />
                <p>The next round of additions and updates are already well underway!</p>
                <br />
                <p>What's coming?</p>
                <h3> *More APIs, more APIs, and even more APIs!*</h3>

                <p class='exampleP'>We will be looking to GREATLY expand the number of APIs
                    <br />
                    we have implemented with the expectation to be well over 50+ by summer 2021
                </p>
                <h4>Possibly even more exciting, will be the implementation of an interactive<br />
                    development environment right into your coding browser!
                </h4>
                <p class='exampleP'>
                    It will enable writing and executing of code<br />
                    live and in real time in a fully interactive sandbox window.
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h4>No need to run nodemon, tab windows, and check localhost:3000 to
                    see what your code returns!
                </h4>
                <br />
                <p class='exampleP'>
                    Think of it as a small code pen built right into your browser!

                    <br />


                    This will enable us to not only provide you with live working fetches,
                    <br />
                    but allow you to easily customize the queries and see what it returns live,
                    <br />
                    quick, easy and a to fast way to test and implement exactly what you want in your code!
                    <br />



                <h3>Code Editor will be LIVE by end of Spring 2021!</h3>

                </p>
                <p>Imminent addiotionswill be the Yahoo Finance API, SkyScanner, and Pokemon. Down the road the next
                    bulk update will include a Weather Api, Starwars, Marvel, and many many more.<br />

                                    Hi there, I'm Kevin! I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and went
                                    to
                                    college at
                                    San Jose State University. Coding has always been a passion of mine since I was
                                    about 7
                                    years
                                    old. I started teaching myself to program in basic on a T1994A Texas Instruments
                                    computer,
                                    and
                                    was hooked instantly. Beyond coding I have a lot of passions in life from
                                    basketball, to the
                                    UFC, to just enjoying the 'Dad' life and trying to be the best husband and father I
                                    can be.

                                    Professionally I've worn a lot of hats in my life, and not only am I a web
                                    developer, but I
                                    have
                                    a background in sales and entrepreneurship. As a business owner I learned how to
                                    handle and
                                    resolve a wide range of issues which now enables me to approach projects with
                                    confidence and
                                    creativity. I bring my passion for a clean and organized work product into each
                                    project, and
                                    I
                                    love nothing more then working as a team to find the most efficient and elegant
                                    solutions to
                                    complex problems.
